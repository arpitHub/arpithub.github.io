Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist at [Mailgun by Pathwire](https://www.mailgun.com). Prior to this, I have worked as Senior Software Engineer at [Agile Media Lab](http://agilemedialab.in/) for 5 years. I have completed my Master's in Engineering Management from Northeastern University at Boston in 2018 and Bachelor's in Computer Science from Panjab University at Chandigarh in 2011. My interest for Data Science started during my time at Northeastern when I realized that by applying correct knowledge and tools we can generate valuable insights from the data (Of course you have make sure about the integrity of the data). **Self learning** plays a big role in data science field, to this day I keep learning new things everyday and *This is the way!*.
In my leisure time I explore hiking places, [taking photographs](https://www.instagram.com/raw.arpit), play tennis and perform experiments with Raspberry pi(es).

My area of Expertise:
- Predictive Modeling
- Business Intelligence
- Automation

The fascinating thing about Data Science discipline is that if it's used thoughtfully we can see good results. There are no shortcuts for implementing data science projects, so be patient, be smart and keep learning.
