Currently, I'm crunching numbers as a Data Scientist at [Sinch](https://www.sinch.com). Before diving into data, I coded waves as a Senior Software Engineer at [Agile Media Lab](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/weblogs-sl) for 5 years. I earned my Master’s in Engineering Management from Northeastern University in Boston in 2018 and debugged my way through a Bachelor’s in Computer Science at Panjab University in Chandigarh in 2011.

My fascination with Data Science sparked during my Northeastern days, where I realized the power of extracting insights from data—ensuring data integrity, of course! Self-learning is my algorithm of choice in the data science realm—I'm always updating my code.

Off-duty, I'm trailblazing hiking spots, [capturing snapshots](https://www.instagram.com/raw.arpit), serving aces on the tennis court, and cooking up experiments with Raspberry Pis.

Areas of Expertise:

- Predictive Modeling (predicting the future, one dataset at a time)
- Business Intelligence (illuminating business strategies with data-driven insights)
- Automation (making processes as smooth as a well-oiled machine)

The allure of Data Science lies in its ability to deliver data-lightful results. Remember, there are no shortcuts in this data maze—patience, smarts, and continuous learning are the keys to decrypting success!
